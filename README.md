# NeonMod

This is just what I use to just slam my modified code into the new Assembly-CSharp everytime a new update comes out for SCP:SL.

A few comments are given here and there so new people know where to start. I recommend using [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy) to modify the methods **ONE BY ONE**. **You will probably not be able to modify the whole class, so don't ask about it or you'll be ignored.**

## Contents
This is **not** a framework, this is **not** a plugin loader or anything of that sort, as opposed to Smod2 or LabMod. This is a direct modification that includes the following plugins:

> **Stalky106** - [TAB] Edition

:information_source: *Config: `neon_stalky106: true`*

Your good'ol Stalky106. It does some serious weird shit with the cooldowns so if you decompile it you will see pepega stuff.
Double click the portal creation tool to **Stalk** a random player, has an initial cooldown of 80 seconds and, when used, sets its own cooldown to 40 seconds. If it's above 120 seconds for any weird bug it just sets itself to 120 :GWaobloChildPepeShrug: 

> ***Neon* 173's Rework** (by me)

:information_source:  *Config: `neon_173rework: true`*

SCP-173 will blink faster the more people look at him. He just wants some friends. **This makes him way more scarier to face.**

> Heavily modified version of **OhNeinSix** (by Joker119)

:information_source: *Config: `neon_scp096: true`*

A more realistic SCP-096, he can only kill those who looked at him (or got too close) while he was chilling or in panic mode

> **RemoteKeycard** (by iRebbok)

:information_source: *Config: `neon_remotekeycard: true`*

You can open any door (not generators, tho) without needing to have the keycard in the hand.

> **InvisTutorial** (inspired by Joker119)

:information_source: *Config: `neon_invistutorial: false`*

Spectators won't be able to spectate tutorials, they'll just be in the void for them.

> **ReplaceDisconnecteds** (by InsetJesux)

:information_source: *Config: `neon_replacedisconnecteds: true`*

:information_source: *2nd config*: `neon_replace_message: You've replaced a player that disconnected.`

Does what's in the box.
